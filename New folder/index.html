								<h2 class="major">Introduction</h2>
								<p>An aspiring Game Developer and AI programmer. Experienced in Python, currently learning C# and C++, along with Unity 5.</br></br></p>
								<h4>Staffordshire University</h4>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Games Programming Wallpaper.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I am currently enrolled in Staffordshire University as a first year under their BSc (Hons) Games Programming course. 
									My eventual goal is to leave Staffordshire as a specialist in Artificial Intelligence and to go on to work for indie and AAA companies.</br></br></p>

								<h4>Passion</h4>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/marauder.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Despite knowing from a young age that I wanted to program and make games for people to enjoy,
									it was only recently that my passion evolved into becoming an Artificial Intelligence programmer.</br></br>
									The main reason for this was due to games with AI considered complex like Doom Eternal, Ready or Not and Ultrakill.</br></br>
									I found the AI in these games intriguing and extremely enjoyable to watch and interact with as they would react to the player's actions accordingly, 
									yet would also take initiative on some actions despite the lack of player intervention. </br></br>This type of AI is seomthing that I would like to emulate in one of my games one day, 
									as to me, the most important things about an AI is that they must be fun to interact with and that they get the player thinking.</p>

								<p><b>To view the trailer, you can click on the UF-Foe Poster.</b></br></br>
									UF-Foe is a local co-op multiplayer horde shooter built by me and a team of others for our Collab project. 
									In the game you could play as a class from a selection of 4 options where each class had a unique weapon. 
									The goal of the game is to collect all your ship parts scattered across the map to fix it and escape
								</br></br>My contribution to UF-Foe was the creation of all the enemy AI, 
								which consists of a melee enemy, which had 2 variations made from it, a ranged shooting enemy
								 and a boss style enemy that has a second phase where they charge at the players.</br></br>UF-Foe was made in about 2 months.</br></br></p>

								<p><b>To view a demo of the completed game, you can click on the John Wick Neon menu screen.</b></br></br>
									John Wick Neon is a top-down shooter heavily inspired by the John Wick franchise and the Hotline Miami games. 
									It was created as the 4th project for my Rapid Games Prototyping university module. It features an ammo system, sprite sheet animations,
									a weapon inventory, two enemy types and enemy AI pathfinding.</br></br>John Wick Neon was made in just over 2 weeks.</br></br>

								<h4>Cosmonaut Hustle</h4>

								<p><b>To view a demo of the completed game, you can click on the Cosmonaut Hustle menu screen.</b></br></br>
									Cosmonaut Hustle is a 2D platformer centered around rocket jumping and has influences from the games DOOM and Papers, Please.
									It was created as the 3rd project for my Rapid Games Prototyping university module. It features sprite animations, 2 distinct enemy types, cutscenes and a rocket jumping mechanic
									that took me 4 iterations of modifying the physics and the character controller to get to a satisfactory level.</br></br>Cosmonaut hustle was made in just over 3 weeks</br></br>

								<h4>Back-Track</h4>
								<a href="https://youtu.be/EWrTlJrAbRI" class="image main"> <img src = "images/Backtrack.png"></a>
								<p><b>To view a demo of the completed game, you can click on the Back-Track menu screen.</b></br></br>
									Back-Track is a 2D platformer made for the Global Games Jam held by Stafforshire University.
									The theme of the games jam was "roots", me and 2 other friends brainstormed ideas and eventually came up with the idea of "rooting in time" and we built the whole game around this mechanic.
									The player could press space and create a "root in time" where he could press space again to "back-track" back to the root and in their original position there would be a clone that used the same controls as the main player.
									Additionally, only the main player would be able to reach the exit door and complete the level.</br></br>
									This created puzzles that required the player to manage both player sprites at the same time as buttons and switches had to be activated before the main player could reach the exit door.
									I was assigned the role of lead/main programmer, I programmed most of the scripts and created most of the prefabs along with the core gameplay mechanic, my other two partners in the games jam created all the levels and UI design.
									</br></br>The game was completed within 48 hours</br>

								<p><b>To view a playlist containing some of the creation process, you can click the Marble Madness title image</b></br></br>
									Marble Madness is a framework provided by one of my University modules. We were tasked with making at least one extra level and a new placeable, 
									I created 2 extra levels, one to show off more of the available placeables along with my own, and pachinko machine-like level for fun. 
									The placeable I created was a cannon that would periodically fire cannonballs in the direction 1the barrel was facing. The cannonballs could fire and knock the player about. 
									</br></br>The 2 levels and placeable were completed in just over 2 weeks.</br></br></p>

								<h4>Tumbleweed</h4>
								<a href="https://youtu.be/KgPBFsQmpEE" class="image main"> <img src = "images/Tumbleweed.png"></a>
								<p><b>To view a demo of the completed game, you can click on the Tumbleweed menu screen.</b></br></br>
									Tumbleweed is a 2 player cowboy game created using S2D, a university owned coding library extension onto C++. 
									Both players die in a single shot, can move left and right and must go through the proecss of unholstering their gun, 
									additionally they also have the ability to dodge, however this consumes a match based resource. 
									I have also created a primitive Artifical Intelligence program utilising choice based random number generation, 
									this means that depending on the choice generated, the next random choice has different paramters for generation.</br></br>
								Tumbleweed was completed in just over 3 days</p>

								<h4>Sink the Sacrifice</h4>
								<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swqsTIbL5PI" class="image main"> <img src = "images/StS.png"></a>
								<p><b>To view a demo of the completed game, you can click on the Sink the Sacrifice menu screen.</b></br></br>
									Sink the Sacrifice is an on-the-rails down scrolling shooter for one of my University modules.
									It is an on-the-rails down scrolling shooter inspired by DownWell featuring 5 levels, a variety of enemy types, a physics based movement system where you would sway the platform to avoid obstacles 
									and a unique "Doom" meter.
									Doom meter fills up via enemy collisions, filling it up entirely will bring you to the final boss. </br></br>Sink the Sacrifice was made in just over a week.</br></br>

								<h2 class="major">Skills</h2>
								<h4 class="major">General Skills</h4>
								<h5>Teamwork</h5>
								<p>Throughout my time in school and at work, I've developed ample teamworking and communication skills. 
									Teamwork allows everyone to draw on each other's strengths via strong communication, to complete problems faster.</br></br></p>
								<h5>Autonomy</h5>
								<p>Although it would be more beneficial to work as a team, I can also work alone. There have been many times where I have had to analyse the situation presented to me
									and work to deal with it by myself. But no matter the situation I will work to the best of my ability.
								</br></br></p>
								<h4 class="major">Programming Skills</h4>
								<h5>Python</h5>
								<p>
									Most of my programming capabilities comes from Python. I was taught it since I was in secondary and continued to use it up until my final year in college. 
									I have learnt so much from database management to even making my own top-down shooter using PyGame and graphical interfaces using Tkinter.</br></br>
								</p>
								<h5>C++</h5>
								<p>
									Ever since I joined Staffordshire, I began learning C++ and although it required me to essentially start from 0, I have been able to quickly adjust and will continue to learn it to the best of my ability.</br></br>
								</p>
								<h5>C#</h5>
								<p>
									Similarly to C++, I also began learning C# due to one of my modules requiring the use of Unity 5 Engine. 
									Again, I have been able to adjust and can impart some of the knowledge I learnt from Python to how I create programs in C# and C++.</br></br>
